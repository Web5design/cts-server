-
- double blind
- meta exhibit
- figures
- fixing logger: user sessions, departure time, automatic reporting of exhibit configuration
- if we gave exhibit authors an analytis suite
- sorting, pagination
- which items are they looking at.
- lense expansion
- hash function that is consistent so same id for an item regarless of which machine loads it.
- Exhibit 2 and three is important, too
- exhibit 3 almost feature compatible
-
- release to current
- see if we sent an email to explain the difference between current and etc
- roll forward a new numbering
- createFromDOM replace with new Object() and then object.initialize()

- The entrypoint for every view and facet is exhibit looks up the rolw in the
dom and then uses taht to look up the proper class and then calls
class.createFromDOM.  CreateFromDOM parses out the settings from the dom object
(data-ex stuff) and then along with each component there is a settings and spec
structure which says what is the field that I want, what is its type, and
default value, and attirbute on dom node that has that. and then there is a
collect settings from dom which reads those to fetch teh settings for that
thing. The createFromDOM is defined for each object unnecessarily: it calls the
constructor, the collect settings, then the configurare thing. These should all
be inherited. when you write a component all that you should write is a thing.
you should never have to write code for configuring based on those settings.
that should be inherited from the component class. COMPONENT object should be
above VIEW and FACET. REGISTRATION of component is something ryan added and is
also shared. DISPOSAL is another thing also added. All about what writing a new
VIEW class should involve is writing the setting specification. What can be
inherited is the collection of setting specification. Another problem is he
wrote parallel methods between contributing from a DOM node and configuraing
from a JSON object. These should be collapsed into one configuration object.

- Create right infrastructure. Tell him to use the views to use it.

- Create survey for larger population of exhibit users.

- Get report in for software engineering class.

- Frank's advisor. Niccolai understands better what the course is about. Thinks
its cool.

Avoid Monday 2:30-4:00 and let David know about learnvis.
