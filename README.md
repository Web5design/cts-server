CTS Server
==========

Running
--------

1. If this is the first time you're running the server, make sure you have all
the required NPM modules.

     ```
     npm install
     ```

2. Start the server.

     ```
     node app/app.js
     ```

This will start the server on port 7000 by default, which the development build
of `cts-ui` is preconfigured to work with.
